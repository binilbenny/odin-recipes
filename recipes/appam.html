    <p><strong> Appam </strong> (also known as "palappam") are tasty, lacy and fluffy pancakes from the Kerala <br> 
        cuisine that are made from ground, fermented rice and coconut batter.</p>
    <p></p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1.5 cups regular rice or parboiled or half-half of both types</li>
        <li>2 cups water for soaking</li>
        <li>¼ cup thick poha (aval or flattened rice) or cooked rice or puffed rice</li>
        <li>½ cup grated fresh coconut</li>
        <li>¾ cup water or as needed for blending or grinding batter</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon instant yeast or ¾ teaspoon dry active yeast</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt or add as required</li>
        <li>tablespoons sugar or add as required</li>
        
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <dt>Step 1:</dt>
        <dd>Rinse rice in water for a couple of times.</dd>

        <dt>Step 2:</dt>
        <dd>Soak rice in water for 4 to 5 hours.</dd>
        
        <dt>Step 3:</dt>
        <dd>Drain all the water and then add the soaked rice to mixer-grinder
            or blender jar.<br> Also add the grated coconut, cooked rice or poha
             (aval or flattened rice), salt and <br> sugar.
        </dd>

        <dt>Step 4:</dt>    
        <dd>Add water and grind all the ingredients to a smooth flowing
             batter
        </dd>

        <dt>Step 5:</dt>
        <dd>Transfer the batter in a medium to large bowl.</dd>

        <dt>Step 6:</dt>
        <dd>With Instant Yeast: Sprinkle the Instant yeast (or rapid rising yeast) all over the <br>
            batter. Mix thoroughly and evenly. Cover the bowl and set aside to ferment for <br> 
            1 to 2 hours until the batter doubles in volume and has plenty of air-pockets.</dd>
        
        <dt>Step 7:</dt>
        <dd>With Dry Active Yeast: Take about 1 to 2 tablespoons of lukewarm water in a <br> 
            bowl. Then add the dry active yeast and stir to mix well. Add this yeast solution <br> 
            to the batter and mix thoroughly. Cover and keep aside for fermenting overnight or for <br> 
            8 to 12 hours or more depending on the temperature conditions. The batter will rise and <br> 
            increase in volume the next day.</dd>

        <dt>Step 8:</dt>
        <dd> a kadai or an appam pan with handles at the sides. Spread some oil on the appam <br> 
            pan with a spoon. If using nonstick pan, then skip smearing the oil.</dd>
        
        <dt>Step 9:</dt>
        <dd>pread a ladle full of the batter (about ⅓ to ¼ cup). Turn and tilt the pan so as to <br> 
            spread the batter to a neat round circle. Keep heat to medium-low or medium. Regulate the <br> 
            heat as needed when cooking.</dd>

        <dt>Step 10:</dt>
        <dd>Drizzle some oil on the sides if you prefer.</dd>

        <dt>Step 11:</dt>
        <dd>Cover the pan with a lid and let the appam cook. The base would become nicely light <br> 
            golden with crispy edges.</dd>

        <dt>Step 12:</dt>
        <dd> remove the cooked appam with a spatula. Make the remaining batches of appam this way. <br> 
            If the pan becomes too hot then reduce the heat so that the batter is easy to spread <br> 
            when you tilt the pan.</dd>


        <dt>Step 13:</dt>
        <dd>Keep the prepared appams covered with a kitchen towel.</dd>

        <dt>Step 14:</dt>
        <dd> the appam hot or warm with vegetable stew or coconut milk that has been sweetened with <br> 
            jaggery and flavored with a bit of cardamom powder.</dd>
